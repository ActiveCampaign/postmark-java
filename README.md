Postmark allows you to send your application's emails with high delivery rates, including bounce/spam processing and detailed statistics. 
In addition, Postmark can parse incoming emails which are forwarded back to your application.

The Postmark Java Library makes it easier to use the Postmark API from your Java 8+ projects without having to build your own API calls. 

## Usage

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-java/wiki) for detailed instructions about sending email, using the bounce api, and other Postmark API options.
